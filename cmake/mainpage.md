## About ##

***Library::STLB*** (*Standard Template Library B*) - the tiny library that contains implementations of powerful algorithms in **C++** language for different purposes: projects, as a small «gear» in big products, competitive programming solutions.
Also, all algorithms and classes designed for intuitive use just like in **STD C++** library.

Features:

- *All sources use only `.hpp` files so library doesn't require any changes in your compilation line arguments*.
- *Library was tested manually, generating random tests, in different competitive programming tasks and even in contests*.
- *Some additional functionality for existing code, new algorithms and data structures will be added later*.
- *Exceptions **is not** used by the library. Therefore if you see any function without `noexcept` - open an issue*.
